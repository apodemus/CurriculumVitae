 abstract = "{Based on XMM--Newton X-ray observations IGR J19552+0044 appears to be
either a pre-polar or an asynchronous polar. We conducted follow-up
optical observations to identify the sources and periods of variability
precisely and to classify this X-ray source correctly. Extensive
multicolor photometric and medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy
observations were performed and period search codes were applied to sort
out the complex variability of the object. We found firm evidence of
discording spectroscopic (81.29+/-0.01m) and photometric
(83.599+/-0.002m) periods that we ascribe to the white dwarf (WD)$\backslash$ spin
period and binary orbital period, respectively. This confirms that IGR
J19552+0044 is an asynchronous polar. Wavelength-dependent variability
and its continuously changing shape point at a cyclotron emission from a
magnetic WD with a relatively low magnetic field below 20 MG. The
difference between the WD spin period and the binary orbital period
proves that IGR J19552+0044 is a polar with the largest known degree of
asynchronism (0.97 or 3\%).

 abstract = "{Two narrow and dense rings (called C1R and C2R) were discovered around
the Centaur object (10199) Chariklo during a stellar occultation
observed on June 3, 2013 (Braga-Ribas et al. 2014). Following this
discovery, we have planned observations of several occultations by
Chariklo's system in order to better characterize the ring and main body
physical properties. Here, we use 12 successful Chariklo's occultations
observed between 2014 and 2016. They provide ring profiles (physical
width, opacity, edge structure) and constraints on their radii and pole
position. Our new observations are currently consistent with the
circular ring solution and pole position, to within the $\pm$ 3.3 km
formal uncertainty for the ring radii, derived by Braga-Ribas et al.
(2014). The six resolved C1R profiles reveal significant width
variations from $\sim$ 5.5 to 7 km. The width of the fainter ring C2R is
less constrained, and may vary between 0.1 and 1 km. The inner and outer
edges of C1R are consistent with infinitely sharp boundaries, with
typical upper limits of one kilometer for the transition zone between
the ring and empty space. No constraint on the sharpness of C2R's edges
is available. A 1$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$ 20 m is derived for the
equivalent width of narrow (physical width $\lt$ 4 km) rings up to
distances of 12,000 km, counted in the ring plane.
